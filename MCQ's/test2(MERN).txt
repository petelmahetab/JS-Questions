                                                         Advanced MERN Stack Interview MCQ Test (2024-2025)
This test contains 20 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) focused on advanced MERN stack concepts (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) commonly asked in big tech firm interviews in 2024 and 2025. Topics include performance optimization, real-time features, security, and system design. Select the correct option (A, B, C, or D) for each question and submit your answers as a list (e.g., [A, B, C, ...]). You’ll receive feedback on whether each answer is correct or incorrect, along with explanations.

1. In MongoDB, what is the primary benefit of using an index on a frequently queried field?

D) Enables real-time data updates across replicas
=>B

2. In Express.js, what is the purpose of the next() function in middleware?
A) Sends the HTTP response to the client
B) Passes control to the next middleware function in the stack
C) Terminates the request-response cycle
D) Parses the request body into JSON.
=>B

3. In React, what happens if you forget to include a key prop when rendering a list of components?
A) React throws a compile-time error
B) React renders the list but logs a warning in the console
C) React skips rendering the list entirely
D) React duplicates the components in the list  
=>B

4. In Node.js, how does the event loop handle asynchronous operations?
A) By executing them in a separate thread pool
B) By queuing callbacks and processing them in a single-threaded loop
C) By pausing synchronous code until asynchronous tasks complete
D) By delegating all asynchronous tasks to the operating system  
=>B

5. How can MongoDB handle relationships between data without foreign key constraints?
A) By using embedded documents or referencing with ObjectIds
B) By enforcing strict relational schemas like SQL
C) By automatically linking documents with matching fields
D) By requiring foreign key constraints for all collections  
=>A

6. In Express.js, how would you implement rate limiting for an API endpoint?
A) Use the express-rate-limit middleware
B) Set a timeout on the server with setTimeout
C) Limit requests in the client-side React application
D) Configure MongoDB to reject excessive queries
=>A  

7. In React, what is the primary purpose of the useCallback hook?
A) To memoize a function to prevent unnecessary re-creations
B) To manage state updates in functional components
C) To handle side effects like data fetching
D) To optimize rendering of child components
=>A

8. In Node.js, what is callback hell, and how can it be mitigated?
A) Nested callbacks; mitigated using Promises or async/await
B) Synchronous code blocking; mitigated with multithreading
C) Excessive event listeners; mitigated with event emitters
D) Memory leaks; mitigated with garbage collection  
=>A

9. In MongoDB, what does sharding enable in a database?
A) Automatic backups of the database
B) Horizontal scaling by distributing data across servers
C) Vertical scaling by increasing server resources
D) Real-time replication of data to secondary nodes
=>B 

10. In Express.js, how does express.static middleware function?
A) Parses incoming JSON payloads
B) Serves static files like images, CSS, or JavaScript
C) Authenticates users for protected routes
D) Compresses HTTP responses for faster delivery
=>B  

11. In React, what is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?
A) Passing props through multiple component levels; avoided with Context API or Redux
B) Overusing props for state management; avoided with useState
C) Mutating props directly; avoided with immutable state
D) Passing props to unrelated components; avoided with useEffect
=>A  

12. In Node.js, what is the benefit of using the cluster module?
A) Enables load balancing across multiple CPU cores
B) Manages database connections automatically
C) Compresses HTTP responses for better performance
D) Handles file system operations asynchronously
=>A  

13. In MongoDB, what is the purpose of the aggregation pipeline?
A) To create indexes for faster queries
B) To process and transform data in multiple stages
C) To replicate data across multiple servers
D) To enforce schema validation on inserts  
=>B

14. In Express.js, how can you secure an API against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks?
A) Use helmet middleware to set security headers
B) Sanitize user inputs with libraries like DOMPurify
C) Enable HTTPS for all API endpoints
D) Use MongoDB’s built-in XSS protection 
=> B

15. In React, what does the useReducer hook provide compared to useState?
A) A simpler way to manage local component state
B) A way to handle complex state logic with a reducer function
C) Automatic memoization of state updates
D) Integration with external state management libraries 
=>B 

16. In Node.js, what is the role of the event-driven architecture?
A) Executes synchronous code in parallel threads
B) Handles asynchronous operations via event listeners and callbacks
C) Manages database connections in a single thread
D) Compresses data for network transmission  
=>B

17. In a MERN application, how would you implement real-time chat functionality?
A) Use WebSockets with Socket.IO and store messages in MongoDB
B) Use REST APIs with polling for message updates
C) Use Express middleware to push messages to clients
D) Use React’s useEffect for real-time updates  
=>A

18. In MongoDB, what is the impact of not using indexes on large collections?
A) Increased disk space usage
B) Slower query performance due to full collection scans
C) Automatic sorting of query results
D) Reduced memory usage during queries  
=>B

19. In React, how does the reconciliation process optimize rendering?
A) By updating the entire DOM on every state change
B) By comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updating only differences
C) By caching the entire DOM in memory
D) By skipping rendering for unchanged components  
=>B
